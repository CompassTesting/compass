= TA Repair Request form overview

The Repair Request form has three sections:

* Title bar
* Progress line
* Form

== Title bar

The title bar lists the repair request information. This includes the:

. Account name
. TA order number
. Command buttons

The command buttons are:

* *Copy Notes* +
This button lets you copy all of the notes (that is, *_comments_*) attached to the request. The notes are then available on your clipboard. You can paste these notes wherever you want. A recommended practice is to save notes as a PDF file, and then print or move the PDF file.

* *Show Note History* +
The *Notes History* section that used to be on the *Repair Request* form has been removed from the form. You can see all comments for the selected repair request by selecting *Show Note History*.

+
The *Show Note History* button has four filters that you can apply to limit the number of notes shown:

*** Customer
*** Technician
*** Location
*** Internal

+
If you clear all the filters, the window shows all notes. You can also select all filters to see all notes. You select one or more filters by selecting them in the filter bar below the window.
[]
The program remembers your filter selections. That is, when you close the *Repair Request* form and reopen it later, the form keeps your previous filters.

* *Show Debug Info* +
Selecting *Show Debug Info* lets you see data TMT Support can use for troubleshooting purposes.

== Progress line

The progress line, which is below the title bar, shows the repair request status. In this illustration, the repair request has moved through the initial phases and is now in _PO Requested_ status:

==  Repair Request form


The *Repair Request* form contains the fields for making the repair request. The form uses different fields based on the repair site selected on the VRO: FIELD, ROAD, or OUTSIDE COMP.

* *_FIELD_* is the default value mapped to the TA *on_premise* field in the Repair Site DEFAULT XREF.

* *_ROAD_* is the default value mapped to the TA *Road Call* field in the Repair Site Default

* *_OUTSIDE COMP_* is the default value mapped to the TA *on_premise* field in the Repair Site DEFAULT XREF.

This illustration shows the *Repair Request* form when the repair site is _OUTSIDE COMP_.

This table lists all fields and the repair sites to which they apply.

[width="100%",cols="20s,20,60",options="header",]
|===
|Field |Repair Site (Outside Comp, Road, Field, All) |Definition
|Location Code |All |The TA shop location mapped to the TMT *Vendor* selected in the VRO Repair Order Header
|Repair Shop |All |The user-defined shop ID number in TMT Web
|Unit |All |The user-defined unit ID number in TMT Web
|VIN |All |The vehicle identification number (VIN) for the unit. The VIN must be exactly 17 characters.
|Integration |All |The integration to use for this repair, such as _TravelCenters of America_
|Purchase Order |All |The TMT Web purchase order number
|Repair Request Status |All |The status of the repair request, such as _Initiate Approved_ or _Estimate Declined_
|Payment Method |All a|How the repair will be paid for, such as _CASH_

*Notes:*

. Effective with V.2022.1, you can update the payment method for VROs that are sent to TA. You must save the VRO header with the updated *Pay Method*. That method must also be a valid *Payment Type* in the TA system. Clicking *Submit* during the _Initiate Awaiting_ or _Estimate Awaiting_ steps triggers the update. You *_cannot_* change the payment method once the VRO reaches the _Estimate Approved_ step.
+
*Example:* Initially, you may have set the payment method to the TA Access account for a tire replacement. Later, you decide to change the payment method to your Goodyear national account. You can open the VRO, update the payment method, and save the VRO header. This will update TA as long as the repair request is in the _Initiate Awaiting_ or _Estimate Awaiting_ status.

. TA can also change TMT *Payment Method*. When this happens, TMT will alert you when you open the *Repair Request* form.

|Asset Location |Field |Where the unit is located, such as _I-85/40 W/B near exit 151_ or _123 Any Street_

Effective with V.2022.3.2, TMT supports defined repair sites for customers using the TA onsite mobile maintenance services. You enter the repair site in the *Asset location* field.

|Driver Name |All |The driver's first and last name
|Driver Phone Number |All a|The phone number where the driver can be reached

The *Driver Phone Number* must comply with the rules below:

* Must be 10 numbers separated by a hyphen between the area code and the preface, and between the preface and the last 4 digits. The phone number should use this mask: pass:[###-###-####]
* Digits cannot be sequential
* Digits cannot be all the same unless they are all zeroes
* Required before detailing the work order

|National Account Number |All |The customer's national tire account number to be used for invoicing purposes

This field is an open text field. You can edit it until the repair request reaches the _Finalize Approved_ step in the TA workflow.

If the customer does not enter a tire account number that is valid in the TA system, then TA updates the value to a valid number for your company automatically after the current step is submitted.
|Tech Arrival Date |Field |The estimated date and time of arrival of the technician at the asset location
|Truck Arrival Date |Outside Comp +
Road |The estimated date and time of arrival of the unit at the TA shop location
|Authorization Number |All |This field defaults to the VRO number.

You can edit this field any time before the order reaches the Estimate Awaiting step in the TA workflow. After the estimated awaiting step, this field is read-only. You can enter up to 20 characters in the field.

|External Repair |All |This number is a combination of the TA shop location ID number and the work order number. The three digits before the slash are the shop ID. The six digits after the slash are the TA work order number.

*Example:* _123/123456_

|Repair Order |All |The TMT Web vendor repair order number
|Associated Unit |All a|
The form shows this field if the TMT *Display Associated Unit Field* Integration option is set to _YES_.

* If the *Associated Unit Number* field has a value on the TMT *Repair Order Detail* page, the *Associated Unit Number* on the *Repair Request* form will match that value.

* If the **Associated Unit Number** is blank on the *TMT Repair Order Detail* page, either the *Associated Unit Number* on the Repair Request form will be blank, or it can show the tractor number that TA sends with the repair details.
